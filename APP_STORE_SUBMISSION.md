WHY GROUP SING ALONG?

We built this app because we love singing together. Whether it's holiday carols with family, campfire songs with friends, or karaoke night at home, there's something magical about voices joining together.

But coordinating group singing was always awkward. Printing lyrics, passing phones around, or hoping everyone knows the words — it never quite worked.

Group Sing Along fixes that. One host, unlimited fun. Everyone sees lyrics together, in sync, on their own device.

Download now and make your next gathering one to remember.
